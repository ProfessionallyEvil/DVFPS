# DVFPS

DVFPS aims to demonstrate the core risks which are detailed in the [OWASP Game Security Framework](https://owasp.org/www-project-game-security-framework/).

# Project Goals

The project aims to align with the OWASP Game Security Framework to serve as a practical demonstration of the concepts defined within. The project also aims to implement the following systems with various deliberate vulnerabilites:

- [ ] Deathmatch game mode
- [ ] Team Deathmatch game 
- [ ] Bomb plant game mode
- [ ] User accounts
- [ ] Embedded cosmetics store page
- [ ] Standalone launcher application (separate repo)
- [ ] Infrastructre as code deployments (sparate repo)
- [ ] Configurable game security features
- [ ] Configurable network architectures
- [ ] Hacking CTF mode (*TODO* design this concept)
